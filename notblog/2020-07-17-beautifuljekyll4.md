[Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) started out as a modest weekend project 5 years ago that I never expected anyone outside my home to see. Today, it's one of the top Jekyll/GitHub Pages themes with over 10,000 GitHub stars+forks.

Starting from day 1, the goal with Beautiful Jekyll has been to allow anyone--and I mean literally *anyone* regardless of coding skill--to create a simple, clean, customziable website within minutes. From 2015-2019 I incrementally added new features to make the theme easier to use and more customizable, but I was always wary about making large-scale changes. 

Then COVID-19 happened. 

I found myself stuck at home and had some time to dedicate to Beautiful Jekyll. The past several months have been a very long journey with hundreds of hours (not an exaggeration) and some very (VERY) late nights, but I'm happy to announce that Beautiful Jekyll has graduated from v1 to v4. Yes, that's right, it jumped 3 major versions! I was planning on just doing a v2, but I kept getting excited by more big changes and I couldn't stop until I was fully satisfied. 

### What changed?

A lot.

From adding many small features, to completely re-working the documentation and the codebase, to migrating to Bootstrap 4, there was a lot to do. I had myself a list of tasks I wanted to accomplish, and on top of that I took a good look at all the open bug reports and feature requests that people submitted and tackled almost all of them.

For a full list of new features and changes, see the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). Highlights include:

- Migrated from Bootstrap 3 to Bootstrap 4 (specifically from 3.3.2 to 4.4.1). This was not fun.
- Made the theme available as a [Rubygem](https://beautifuljekyll.com/getstarted#method_gem)
- Made the theme available using `remote_theme` through [GitHub Pages](https://beautifuljekyll.com/getstarted#method_remote_theme_github) or through a [Ruby Jekyll site](https://beautifuljekyll.com/getstarted#method_remote_theme_jekyll)
- Added some accessibility features and improved performance of the theme
- Rewrote and greatly simplified the entire documentation to make it as simple and easy to understand while still explaining all the features
- Rewrote almost the entire codebase, make the theme 100% truly responsive by rewriting all CSS, cleaned up many of the files/folders that were not essential
- Since the web today is very photo-heavy, added a few options for images in posts: `thumbnail-image`, `share-img`, and `cover-img`
- Updated to the latest jQuery and font-awesome (they were 5+ years old!)
- Create a separate [GitHub repository](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll-demo) for the demo site that uses `remote_theme` as an example of how to use Beautiful Jekyll using `remote_theme`
- The demo website is now hosted on its very own domain [beautifuljekyll.com](https://beautifuljekyll.com/)
