[Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) started out as a modest weekend project 5 years ago that was never expected to be seen by anyone outside of my house. Today, it's one of the top Jekyll/GitHub Pages themes available with over 10,000 GitHub stars+forks.  Other than gaining users, Beautiful Jekyll has also gained a lot of features.
